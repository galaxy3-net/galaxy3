  This script "env" is used to temporarily setup the Galaxy3 variables needed for managing hosts and services in the Galaxy3 environment.  These settings are temporary as they will be lost when this (shell/bash/GitBash) is closed.

  You must run this everytime a new shell/bash/Gitbash is opened.

  There are multiple ways for running this script as follows.

  cd ~/galaxy3 && . ./env
  cd ~/galaxy3 && source ./env

  . ~/galaxy3/env
  source ~/galaxy3/env

  The following maintenance ommands are ready for maintaing the Galaxy3 environment.
