  This script "env" is used to temporarily setup the Galaxy3 variables needed
  for managing hosts and services in the Galaxy3 environment.  These settings
  are temporary as they will be lost when this (shell/bash/GitBash) is closed.

  You must run this everytime a new shell/bash/Gitbash is opened.

  There are multiple ways for running this script as follows.

  cd ~/galaxy3 && . ./env
  cd ~/galaxy3 && source ./env

  . ~/galaxy3/env
  source ~/galaxy3/env
